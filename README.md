## Expense Tracker 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I built this project to get familiar with the basics of react. I learnt how to manipulate state, props & I utilized several react hooks like useEffect, and a localStorage hook from Youtube.
